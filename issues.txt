ISSUES BOARD TO TRACK BRANCHES / ISSUE STATUSES


Structure for Branches
Branch Name (format as 'issue-[##]'): ____
Issue/Idea being Explored: ____
Current Status (New, Pending, Finished): ____


Basic Git Commands:
git status --> shows you what files you editted 
git add --> stage your changes 
git commit --> commit your changes
git push --> pushes your commit to your branch 

Git Commands regarding Branches:
git switch --> switch between branches
git branch --> see what branch you're on or create a new one
git checkout --> similar to git switch (older version)
git merge --> connect your branch to another branch

Note:
- There's not a short explanation of branching, it's quite complicated, so please watch a video, ask chat, or ask Johnny
- Nobody else can see changes on your local environment if you don't commit it 
- You can always go back to an old commit in history, but don't get in the habit of committing bad code just to go back
